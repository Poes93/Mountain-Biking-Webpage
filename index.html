                <li><strong>Body Positioning:</strong> Maintain a balanced stance with elbows slightly bent and knees
                    flexed. Shift your weight according to terrain changes for better control.</li>
                <li><strong>Gearing:</strong> Learn to use your bike's gears effectively. Shift to lower gears for
                    uphill climbs and higher gears for downhill stretches.</li>
                <li><strong>Braking Technique:</strong> Use both front and rear brakes evenly to avoid skidding.
                    Gradually apply brakes and shift your body weight backward on steep descents.</li>
                <li><strong>Cornering Confidence:</strong> Lean your bike into turns while keeping your body upright.
                    Focus your gaze toward the exit of the turn for better stability.</li>
