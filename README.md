### Bugs

These are the current bugs on the website. I can't seem to find out how to currently solve them but they most goes down to the Navbar and header part

* When opening the page on mobile the nav menu is already open and to close it one need to press the bars to close the menu. Same when pressing the links, the menu wont disapear automatically. 

* Scaling for Hero image and position may differ on webrowser but also needs more adjustment on phone.

* Header text wont adjust evenly when on different screen sizes.

* When pressing the links as the header is always on top and the links goes to the section header, it will be hidden under the header.

* Some issues with scaling the nav bar that it sometimes disapears. Reload the page will solve that issue for now.
