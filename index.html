            <h5>About Mountain Biking: A Thrilling Adventure on Two Wheels</h5>

            <p>Mountain biking isn't just a sport; it's a way of life that immerses riders in the heart of nature's
                challenges and wonders. It's a unique blend of adrenaline, skill, and camaraderie that draws enthusiasts
                to conquer rugged terrains, steep ascents, and exhilarating descents. Whether you're a beginner seeking
                the thrill of your first trail or an experienced rider pushing your limits, mountain biking offers an
                experience like no other.</p>

            <h4>History and Evolution</h4>

            <p>Mountain biking traces its roots back to the 1970s when a group of passionate riders started modifying
                their bicycles to tackle off-road trails. This early exploration laid the foundation for the diverse and
                dynamic sport we know today. As technology advanced, specialized mountain bikes were developed,
                featuring robust frames, suspension systems, and innovative components to enhance performance on rough
                terrain. Disciplines like cross-country, downhill, enduro, and freeride emerged, each requiring distinct
                skills and techniques.</p>

            <h4>A Connection with Nature</h4>

            <p>One of the core appeals of mountain biking is the intimate connection it provides with the natural world.
                Trails wind through lush forests, across alpine meadows, and along breathtaking ridges. Riders witness
                changing landscapes, encounter wildlife, and experience the tranquility of remote environments that few
                get to explore. The rhythmic cadence of pedaling, the rush of wind, and the scent of pine trees all
                contribute to an immersive experience that rejuvenates the spirit.</p>

            <h5>Gear and Equipment</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mountain Bike:</strong> Choose a bike that suits your riding style. Full-suspension bikes
                    are great for challenging terrain, while hardtails are versatile and efficient on smoother trails.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Helmet:</strong> Safety comes first. Invest in a high-quality helmet that fits snugly and
                    provides adequate protection for your head.</li>
                <li><strong>Protective Gear:</strong> Consider knee and elbow pads, gloves, and padded shorts for added
                    protection during more intense rides.</li>
                <li><strong>Apparel:</strong> Wear moisture-wicking clothing for comfort. Cycling shorts, jerseys, and
                    proper footwear enhance your ride.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydration System:</strong> Stay hydrated on the trail with a water bottle or a hydration
                    pack.</li>
                <li><strong>Repair Kit:</strong> Carry essentials like a spare tube, tire levers, multi-tool, and a
                    mini-pump for quick repairs.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunglasses:</strong> Protect your eyes from debris, UV rays, and glare with suitable
                    eyewear.</li>
                <li><strong>Trail Maps and GPS:</strong> Navigate confidently with trail maps or a GPS device to explore
                    new routes.</li>

        <section id="tips">
            <h5>Tips and Techniques</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Body Positioning:</strong> Maintain a balanced stance with elbows slightly bent and knees
                    flexed. Shift your weight according to terrain changes for better control. Proper body positioning
                    not only enhances stability but also allows you to absorb shocks and bumps effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Gearing:</strong> Learn to use your bike's gears effectively. Shift to lower gears for
                    uphill climbs, maintaining a steady cadence to conserve energy. On downhill sections, shift to
                    higher gears to maintain control and avoid spinning out.</li>
                <li><strong>Braking Technique:</strong> Master the art of braking. Use both front and rear brakes evenly
                    to prevent skidding. Gradually apply the brakes rather than squeezing them suddenly. For steep
                    descents, shift your body weight backward to prevent flipping over.</li>
                <li><strong>Cornering Confidence:</strong> Conquering corners is a mix of technique and courage. Lean
                    your bike into turns while keeping your body upright. Focus your gaze on the exit of the turn to
                    maintain balance and control.</li>
                <li><strong>Climbing Strategy:</strong> Climbing demands efficiency. Maintain a consistent pedal stroke
                    and distribute your weight evenly between the handlebars and saddle. Standing on the pedals can
                    provide extra power on steep climbs.</li>
