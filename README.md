And the primarily used palette that consists of oranges (like #f29b3d), dark colors (like #191919 and #6B6B6B), and the "firebrick" color (#B22222).

## Features

The website is a one page website, with links to the different sections of the page

  * The header and nav bar will follow through the website while scrolling.

  * A footer which contains social media icon links to instagram and goodreads. There is also an envelope icon which takes the user to the contact us page. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.

  * Each section is a new category and the information about each topic 
    #About Mountain Biking: A Thrilling Adventure on Two Wheels
    #Trails & Destinations: Your Path to Mountain Biking Euphoria
    #Gear and Equipment
    #Tips and Techniques
    #Contact

* There is a form in the bottom for users to send in questions

* Social media links in the bottom of the website

* Future Implementations.
  * More sections and information
  * Times and schedules
  * Better allignment of the navbar to title text
  * Better allignemnt of the text sections 

  
### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

I want to adding more section, maybe some times the trails would be at

Fixing the bugs 


### Accessibility
